It is situated in Palestine, Gaza where it offers high level instructing of the Palestinian school curriculum. HFS has a very high standard for admission, and that is certainly for a reason. It focuses on the deep understanding of scientific subjects like Mathematics and Physics, while also demanding its students to exhibit a strong sense of creativity in subjects like Arabic and English literature. HFS puts an immense effort in embedding a rich experience into its students, molding their characters to be more strong and resilient. This is exactly how I, Zuhair, would describe being a student at Holy Family School.</p>
